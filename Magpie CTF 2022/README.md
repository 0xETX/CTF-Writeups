# Magpie 2022 CTF
This CTF was hosted by the University of Calgary between February 25th and February 27th.

While our team didn't have any notable placings, it was probably one of the best individual performances I've had in a CTF!
Some notable accomplishments:
  - First Blood on "Compare and Contrast"
  - First Blood on "Tracking A CEO Part III"
  - First person to solve all of the OSINT category, and did so individually

Looking forward to the next Magpie CTF!
