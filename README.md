# CTF-Writeups
Writeups for CTF challenges I have completed in the past. Contains different challenge categories such as Programming, Forensics, OSINT, Mobile and many, many more!

## Structure
Each CTF challenge is seperated into folders by the CTF name. Each folder will contain a 'README.md' file that briefly talks about each CTF. In the same folder, there will also be more folders that are seperated by individual challenges.

Within these folders, there will be a file named '{challengeName}.md' that will serve as the guide to each challenge. The folder will be filled with any other materials I created during the challenges such as script files. Other than that, there will typically be an image folder that just contains any images I used for the write-up - all of these will be available the in {challengeName}.md file.
