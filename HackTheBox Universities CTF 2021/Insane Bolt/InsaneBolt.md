Insane Bolt is a programming challenge that was available during the HackTheBox Universities CTF 2021. This challenge has the user play a robot that has to follow a path of screws until they reach a diamond. The player accomplishes this by sending a string consisting for 'D' (for down), 'R' (for right) and 'L' (for left). The order of the characters in the string is the order the player will move. If the user goes into the wrong direction (a skull or fire emoji), they will lose and are forced to restart.

## Getting Started
Before starting the challenge, the first thing we must do is understand how the challenge works. To start this off, the first thing I will do is connect to the challenge using Telnet as seen in Figure 1.0. 

Once the connection is established, we can immediately notice that we have 2 options - 1 is for instructions, 2 is for play. To keep this write-up to the point, we'll just select 'Play'.

After selecting play, we'll immediately notice a grid is displayed to the user (Figure 1.1).

There are several things to note with this grid, starting with the emojis.
1. Fire Emoji - This emoji solely serves as a border to the grid.
2. Skull Emoji - This emoji represents spaces that will immediately eliminate the player.
3. Robot Emoji - This emoji represents the player.
4. Screw Emoji - These serve as the 'path' the player must follow.
5. Diamond Emoji - Collecting this emoji immediately ends the current map and generates the next one.

After understanding how the emojis and game works, the next step is to start noticing patterns with the challenge.
1. Some paths are dead-ends. These dead-ends will not have any steps to go 'Down'.
2. The first move will always start with a 'D' move.
3. If there is a single screw in a row, it is guarenteed to be a safe path.

Now that these important notes have been made, we can begin creating the script.
