Insane Bolt is a programming challenge that was available during the HackTheBox Universities CTF 2021. This challenge has the user play a robot that has to follow a path of screws until they reach a diamond. Some false paths are created that are made to trick the user into going the wrong way - if the user goes into the wrong path, they will lose and are forced to restart.
